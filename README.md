Frontend:

1.Display users in cards format with pagination: The users should be displayed in a visually appealing card format. Implement pagination to display 20 users per page.

2.Search by Name: Users should be able to search for users by their names. As the user types in the search input, the list of displayed users should be dynamically updated to match the search query.

3.Add 3 filters: Implement three filters - Domain, Gender, and Availability. Users should be able to select multiple filters simultaneously, and the displayed user list should be updated accordingly.

4.Create a team: Users should be able to create a team by selecting users from the list. Only users with unique domains and availability should be selectable for the team (similar to adding items to a cart in e-commerce websites).

5.Show team details: Once the team is created, display the details of the team, including the selected users' information.

6.Make it responsive: Ensure that the application is responsive and displays properly on different screen sizes.
